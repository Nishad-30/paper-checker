# paper-checker
The "Automated Paper Checking System" represents a pioneering initiative aimed at transforming the conventional approach to grading answer sheets. It aims to tackle the inherent challenges present in manual evaluation methods, including time-intensive processes, subjective biases, and the potential for human errors.

# Problem Statement
The problem statement revolves around the development of a comprehensive system capable of 
automating the evaluation of answer sheets. The system will involve multiple users, including teachers, administrators, and students. Teachers will input the correct answers, while studentâ€™s answer sheets will be scanned and processed using OCR technology to extract text. The system will then compare the extracted answers with the correct solutions using the Cosine similarity test from the K-nearest Neighbors algorithm. The expected output includes accurate assessments of students' performance, eliminating the need for manual grading and reducing the associated time and resource costs.

# Need of Project
The reason we need the Automated Paper Checking System is because grading papers by hand takes a lot of time and can lead to mistakes. Also, sometimes teachers might be biased without meaning to be. With more and more classes moving online, we need a way to grade papers quickly and fairly. This project uses technology like computers and special software to help teachers grade papers faster and more accurately. It saves time for teachers and helps make sure students get fair grades.The background of the domain encompasses advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the fields of natural language processing and pattern recognition, which have enabled the development of sophisticated algorithms for text analysis and comparison. Additionally, the proliferation of digital tools, coupled with the increasing adoption of online education platforms, underscores the need for automated assessment solutions that can scale with the growing demand for educational services.

# Software And Hardware Requirements
The Automated Paper Checking System adopts a contemporary technological framework, with Python serving as the primary language for backend development. Within this backend environment, Django, a robust web framework, is employed to facilitate the creation of web applications, ensuring efficient and scalable development. On the frontend side, the system leverages a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft the user interface and deliver an engaging user experience. This frontend stack allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive interfaces that interact seamlessly with the backend. Furthermore, to handle the processing of uploaded question papers in PDF format, the system may utilize specialized libraries such as PyPDF2. These libraries provide functionality for parsing, extracting data, and manipulating PDF documents, ensuring smooth integration of PDF handling capabilities within the application. Lastly, in terms of development environment and deployment, the codebase is hosted locally on Visual Studio Code. This choice of IDE (Integrated Development Environment) offers a comprehensive set of tools and features for coding, debugging, and project management, facilitating efficient development and testing of the application before deployment.
